Minimum Blazor Code to use Send Grid for Email

Email pages added to the out-of-the-box Blazor Server template to illustrate the bare minumum code needed to connect to and use SendGrid for email.

Video may follow.

For people like me who haven't learned the prerequisites to use Blazor ;).

Good luck!
